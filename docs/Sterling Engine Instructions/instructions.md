2.  **Gather Crank Components (Top View)**
    Ensure all crank pieces are present and accounted for, as shown from a top view.
    ![Verify crank pieces from a top view](<01 Crank/01-pieces_top.png>)

3.  **Assemble Crank (Quarter View)**
    Begin assembling the crank, paying close attention to the orientation as depicted in the quarter view.
    ![Assemble the crank components as shown in the quarter view](<01 Crank/02-assembled_quarter_view.png>)

4.  **Complete Crank (Side View)**
    Inspect your completed crank assembly from a side view to ensure it matches the reference.

## 02 Cylinder

1.  **Insert Colored Liners**
    Carefully insert the colored liners into the cylinder body. Ensure they are seated correctly.
    ![Insert colored liners into the cylinder](<02 Cylinder/01-insert_colored_liners.png>)

2.  **Gather Piston Pieces**
    Collect all the individual components required for the piston assembly.
    ![Gather all the pieces for the piston assembly](<02 Cylinder/02-gather_piston_pieces.png>)

3.  **Glue Hollow Shaft into Working Piston**
    Take the working piston and securely glue the hollow shaft into its designated slot.

## 03 Base

1.  **Attach Legs and Support**
    Begin by attaching the main legs and support structures to the base plate.
    ![Attach the legs and support structures to the base](<03 Base/01-attach_legs_and_support.png>)

2.  **Gather Motor Pieces**
    Gather all the components necessary for the motor assembly.
    ![Collect all the motor pieces](<03 Base/03-gather_motor_pieces.png>)

3.  **Place Motor**
    Carefully place the motor into its designated mounting position on the base.
    ![Place the motor onto the base](<03 Base/04-place_motor.png>)

4.  **Attach Pulley**
    Securely attach the pulley to the motor shaft.
    ![Attach the pulley to the motor shaft](<03 Base/05-attach_pulley.png>)

5.  **Attach Motor Cover**
    Place and secure the motor cover over the installed motor assembly. Route the cable out the hole in the side of the motor block
    ![Attach the cover over the motor](<03 Base/06-attach_motor_cover.png>)

6.  **Insert Battery Box**
    Insert the battery box into its designated compartment within the base structure.
    ![Insert the battery box into its slot](<03 Base/07-insert_battery_box.png>)

7.  **Assembled Base Overview**
    Review the complete base assembly, ensuring all components are correctly installed.

## 04 Fins

1.  **Attach Fins**
    Carefully attach the heat fins to the designated area on the cylinder or engine body.
    ![Attach the heat fins to the engine](<04 Fins/01-attach_fins.png>)

2.  **Front View of Attached Fins**
    Examine the engine from a front view to confirm the correct and even attachment of the fins.
    ![Front view of the engine with fins attached](<04 Fins/01-front_view.png>)

## 05 Final

1.  **Glue Cylinder to Support**
    Apply adhesive and firmly glue the assembled cylinder unit to its support structure on the base. You will also insert the crankshaft into the vertical supports as pictured.
    ![Glue the cylinder assembly to its support on the base](<05 Final/01-glue_cylinder_to_support.png>)

2.  **Attach Pulley**
    Attach the main drive pulley to the crankshaft, ensuring it is secure and aligned. Stretch the elastic band (not pictured) around the motor pulley and the crank shaft pulley, it should slot into the grove on the pulleys.
    ![Attach the main drive pulley to the crank](<05 Final/02-attach_pully.png>)

3.  **Attach Flywheel**
    Securely fasten the flywheel to the crankshaft. Ensure it spins freely and without wobble.
    ![Attach the flywheel to the crankshaft](<05 Final/03-attach_fly_wheel.png>)

4.  **Gather Feet**
    Collect all the individual support feet for the base of the engine.
    ![Gather all the feet components](<05 Final/04-gather_feet.png>)

5.  **Attach Feet**
    Attach the gathered feet to the bottom of the base, providing stability for the engine.
    ![Attach the feet to the bottom of the base](<05 Final/05-attach_feet.png>)
